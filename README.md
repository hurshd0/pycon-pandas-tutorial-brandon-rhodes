# Welcome to Brandon’s Pandas Tutorial

The first instance of this tutorial was delivered at PyCon 2015 in
Montréal, but I hope that many other people will be able to benefit from
it over the next few years — both on occasions on which I myself get to
deliver it, and also when other instructors are able to do so.

If you want to follow along with the tutorial at home, here is the
YouTube recording of the 3-hour tutorial at PyCon itself:

To make it useful to as many people as possible, I hereby release it
under the MIT license (see the accompanying `LICENSE.txt` file) and I
have tried to make sure that this repository contains all of the scripts
needed to download and set up the data set that we used.
